* Currently working with Professor William J. Welch, and Senior Data Scientist Hao Chen to develop Bayesian methods for GaSP 2.0.0, who first published their Bayesian Gaussian Process method on SIAM/ASA Journal.
* The Bayesian methods proposed show some distinct advantages in terms of prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification and will allow GaSP to be even more flexible. 
* Professor William J. Welch and I have plans for version 3.0.0 in the near future.
