* To create an ego-centric predictive model of vehicle motion conditioned on past positions of both the ego vehicle and the motion of other agents moving around the same intersection near the same place in space and time, our group utilized two MLP models to train the x and y coordinates of the ego vehicle, we used the vehicles current positions as well as the coordinates of the neighbouring objects to predict the future positions of the ego vehicle. 
* GitHub link will be added soon.
