* Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge is a well-known Kaggle competition, the objective is to find the most accurate method to classify this dataset into the classes "tau tau decay of a Higgs boson" versus "background". 
* Our team is currently evaluating classification models such as PCA, random forest, logistic regression and are going to utilize ensemble methods with parallel computing.
* The link to the project will be provided soon.
