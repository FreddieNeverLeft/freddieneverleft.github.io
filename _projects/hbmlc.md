* Higgs Boson Machine Learning Challenge is a well-known Kaggle competition, the objective is to find the most accurate method to classify this dataset into the classes "tau tau decay of a Higgs boson" versus "background". 
* Our team is currently evaluating regularization methods such as LASSO and ridge, as well as trying classification models such as random forest, logistic regression and possibly ultilize ensemble methods.
* The link to the project will be provided soon.
