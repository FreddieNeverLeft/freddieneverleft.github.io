* The goal of our project is to capture and represent the events that happen throughout the NBA season. We created a database that focuses on recording the team/player statistics after each game and the corresponding effect it has on the other administration/operational entities that support the league.

* All code used in the application:
- The webpage can be accessed at
https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~mshizhe/admin.php
- All code are included in the repository below, there the script to create all tables
is named “NBA.sql” https://github.com/Justinyangjy/CPSC_304_NBA
