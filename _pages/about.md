About me
======
I am a 4th year science student with a specialization in combined major of CS and STATS at University of British Columbia. Coming from a background from both computer science and statistics, I have a strong fundamental in programming as well as mathematics. My upper-level courses had a focus in machine learning, statistical learning, and AI and provided me an invalubale insight to the many aspects of ML and AI that I am highly motivated to continue my studies in.

Reasearch Interests
======
Coming from a bachelors degree, my interests are still broad, but here is some of directions I am interested in:

* Statistical and Machine learning:
  * Handling of high dimensional data /large-scale Statistical and Machine learning in fields such as computer vision and biomedical research. Nowadays, data grow too complex for traditional methods and the need for developing new methods arises. I am interested both in the mathematical aspects of these problems as well as their applications.
  * Deep learning methods and their applications.
* Artificial Intelligence
  * Reinforcement Learning
  * Applications on robtics such as self-driving cars.
